# Recruitment Exercises - JavaScript basic & intermediate stuff

Hi there!

Make sure to run `npm i` after switching to different branch.

To run the server - `npm run dev`.

Every task is completed in a different branch. Available branches:

```bash
git switch inline-editing
git switch konami-code
git switch microblog
git switch rainbow-table
git switch searchbox
```

Leaving feedback would be very appreciated!
